CREATING THE schema “Rehab”,
Creating table-
CREATE TABLE Patients (
    PatientID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DOB DATE,
    AdmissionDate DATE,
    DischargeDate DATE,
    TreatmentPlan VARCHAR(100),
    AssignedTherapist VARCHAR(100),
    ContactEmail VARCHAR(100),
    ContactPhone VARCHAR(20),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    State VARCHAR(50),
    EmergencyContactName VARCHAR(100),
    EmergencyContactPhone VARCHAR(20),
    InsuranceProvider VARCHAR(100),
    InsurancePolicyNumber VARCHAR(20)
);
Inserting the Values into it

1.	Display whole table-
SELECT * FROM rehab.patients

2.	Avg. patient age-
SELECT AVG(YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(DOB)) AS AverageAge FROM Patients;

3.	Get the total number of patients per treatment plan:
SELECT TreatmentPlan, COUNT(*) AS PatientCount FROM Patients GROUP BY TreatmentPlan;



4.	Duration of stay for each patient:
SELECT PatientID, FirstName, LastName, AdmissionDate, DischargeDate, 
       DATEDIFF(DischargeDate, AdmissionDate) AS DurationOfStay
FROM Patients;

5.	Patients with same emergency contact num.-
SELECT EmergencyContactPhone, COUNT(*) AS NumPatients
FROM Patients
GROUP BY EmergencyContactPhone
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

6.	Find Patients with Similar Treatment Plans in Different Cities:
SELECT p1.PatientID, p1.FirstName, p1.LastName, p1.TreatmentPlan, p1.City AS City1, p2.City AS City2
FROM Patients p1
JOIN Patients p2 ON p1.PatientID <> p2.PatientID
  AND p1.TreatmentPlan = p2.TreatmentPlan
  AND p1.City <> p2.City;

7.	Finding out inconsistency in data:
SELECT *
FROM Patients
WHERE DischargeDate < AdmissionDate;


8.	Youngsters involved in substance abuse recovery:
SELECT *
FROM Patients
WHERE YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(DOB) < 25
  AND TreatmentPlan = 'Substance Abuse Recovery';


9.	Longest rehabilitation duration:
SELECT PatientID, FirstName, LastName, TreatmentPlan, DATEDIFF(DischargeDate, AdmissionDate) AS RehabilitationDuration
FROM Patients
ORDER BY RehabilitationDuration DESC
LIMIT 5;


10.	Therapist assigned with highest number of patients-
SELECT AssignedTherapist, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfPatients
FROM Patients
GROUP BY AssignedTherapist
ORDER BY NumberOfPatients DESC
LIMIT 5;

11.	Grouping each medical disorder and age group in them:
SELECT
    TreatmentPlan,
    CASE
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DOB, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 18 AND 30 THEN '18-30'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DOB, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 31 AND 45 THEN '31-45'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DOB, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 46 AND 60 THEN '46-60'
        ELSE '61+'
    END AS AgeGroup,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfPatients
FROM
    patients
GROUP BY
    TreatmentPlan,
    AgeGroup
ORDER BY
    TreatmentPlan,
    AgeGroup;

12.	Grouping similar treatments into one-
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN TreatmentPlan IN ('Mental Health Rehabilitation', 'Anxiety Treatment', 'Depression Management') THEN 'Mental Disorders'
        ELSE TreatmentPlan
    END AS GroupedTreatment,
    COUNT(*) AS PatientCount
FROM
    Patients
GROUP BY
    GroupedTreatment;

13.	Patient with similar treatment plans but different therapists:
SELECT
    PatientID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    TreatmentPlan,
    AssignedTherapist
FROM
    Patients
WHERE
    (TreatmentPlan, State) IN (
        SELECT
            TreatmentPlan,
            State
        FROM
            Patients
        GROUP BY
            TreatmentPlan, State
        HAVING
            COUNT(DISTINCT AssignedTherapist) > 1
    )
LIMIT 5;

14.	Treatment Plan Transition Analysis:
SELECT
    PatientID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    TreatmentPlan AS PreviousTreatmentPlan,
    LEAD(TreatmentPlan) OVER (PARTITION BY PatientID ORDER BY AdmissionDate) AS NextTreatmentPlan
FROM
    Patients
WHERE
    TreatmentPlan IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

15.	Update Patient using treatment plan ‘substance abuse recovery’ will be requiring ‘checkup’:
ALTER TABLE patients
ADD COLUMN required_checkup VARCHAR(3);

UPDATE patients
SET required_checkup = 'yes'
